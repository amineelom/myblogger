## 🔎 What Is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create web pages. It isn’t a programming language—it’s a **markup language** that structures content on the web.  

Think of HTML as the **skeleton of a website**. It defines text, links, images, buttons, and other content.

✔ Example of a simple HTML page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
