## ✅ Do’s: Best Practices for Amazon Affiliates

### 1. Disclose Your Affiliate Relationship
The **FTC requires disclosure** when using affiliate links. Amazon also enforces this.  
✔ Example disclosure:  
> “As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.”

Add this **above or below your affiliate links** and in your website footer.

---

### 2. Use Amazon’s Approved Affiliate Links
Always generate your links from the **Amazon Associates dashboard**.  
Do not use shorteners or modify links — this can trigger a ban.

---

### 3. Keep Content High-Quality & Original
Google and Amazon want **helpful, original content**. Create **reviews, comparisons, and guides** that truly add value. Avoid copy-pasting from Amazon product descriptions.

---

### 4. Stay Updated on Amazon’s Rules
Amazon updates its **Operating Agreement** regularly. Bookmark the [Amazon Associates Policies](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/agreement) and check for changes.

---

### 5. Focus on Mobile Optimization
Over **65% of Amazon sales** come from mobile users in 2025. Make sure your blog is **fast, responsive, and user-friendly** on all devices.

## ❌ Don’ts: Mistakes That Get Affiliates Banned

You can’t just copy and paste Amazon product images. Use Amazon’s **Product Advertising API** or site stripe tool to stay compliant.

---

### 5. Don’t Incentivize Clicks

❌ “Click this Amazon link to support me!”
